                                <p>In the past few years, it was the most confused moment in my life. The job has been constantly changing, and I have probably done eight or nine jobs before and after.
                                </p>
                                <p>At this moment, I don’t know why I live? Why do I work? What does my future look like? I am addicted to a life of luxury and money every night, and I have no plans or ideas for the future.
                                </p>

                                <p>In 2017, I was fortunate to return to BV to work. This company was the place where I stayed briefly when I was working in college.

                                <p>Fortunately, the people here don't care about my qualifications or my past. They are willing to give me a chance to work hard from the lowest level.
                                </p>
                                <p>Among them, what I have changed the most here is to start to learn to think about the future, and compared with the previous work, as long as you work hard here, you will have opportunities. This is something I have never experienced in the past. It is also here that I decided to pick up the book again. Go back to campus and face up to my own future.

                                <p>I am currently studying in the Advanced Study Department of the Department of Engineering and Engineering of Tamkang University. During this semester, in addition to meeting great teachers and absorbing a lot of different knowledge, I also met many students from different places with many different stories behind them.
                                </p>
                                <p>This time I came back to study, in addition to wanting to get the degree I should have obtained and learn a lot of new knowledge, I hope to re-examine myself to those who looked down on me in the past.
                                </p>
